## installation

first, you need the rust development environment installed.

```bash
# install rust if you don't have it
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
source $home/.cargo/env # or restart your terminal
```

then, clone the terminator repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mediar-ai/terminator
cd terminator
```

## running the server

**terminator** works with a client-server architecture. you need to run the rust server first. this server listens for commands from the sdk (typescript, python coming soon) and interacts with the operating system's accessibility apis.

```bash
cargo run --example server -- --debug
```

the `--debug` flag enables verbose logging, which is helpful when starting out.

## using the typescript sdk (quick start)

once the server is running, you can use the typescript sdk to automate ui interactions.

1.  **navigate to the examples directory:**
    ```bash
    cd examples
    ```
2.  **install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    bun install # or npm install / yarn install
    ```
3.  **run the example script:**
    ```bash
    npx tsx client_example.ts
    ```

this example script typically performs a simple automation task, like opening the calculator application (on windows/macos), clicking buttons, and retrieving the result. check the `client_example.ts` file to see the specific actions.

## next steps

*   explore the [[terminator/sdk-reference|TypeScript SDK Reference]] to understand all available commands.
*   look at the `examples/` directory for more usage patterns.
*   start building your own automation scripts!
